=======================

An Objective C NSString category to fix common typos in email addresses. Significantly reduces signup issues and lost users.

Some examples of bad email addresses that will be corrected:

* robert@**gmial.com**	-> robert@gmail.com
* robert@**gmial.*con*** -> robert@gmail.com
* robert@hotmail.**con** -> robert@hotmail.com
* robert@**hoitmail.com** -> robert@hotmail.com
* robert@**hoitmail.con** -> robert@hotmail.com
* robert@aol**.con** -> robert@aol.com
* **robert.con@aol.con** -> robert.con@aol.com


Fixes misspelled variations for Gmail, Googlemail, Hotmail, Yahoo and Ymail. More domains can be added easily using a dictionary syntax. 

Note: A .con suffix will always be corrected to .com regardless of domain name.

Besides correcting the typos, it also lowercases the email address. If the email address is invalid, returns the original value.

**Code sample:**

	NSString *badAddress = @"robert@gmial.com";
	NSString *goodAddress = [badAddress stringByCorrectingEmailTypos];
